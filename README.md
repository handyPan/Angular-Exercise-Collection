# Angular Project Collection

This is a repository for housing the Angular projects. See the demonstration of each project below.

How to run the code locally?
The projects can be run by common server programs such as xampp, nginx, and even Python inbuilt http.server module. The easiest way is to use Python. 

If to use Python, download the "angular" directory and navigate inside it in a terminal. Then run "python -m http.server 1234". Open "http://localhost:1234" in a browser. Note for "university-picker" project, "json-server" should have been installed, then to serve the db.json file, run "json-server --watch university-picker\assets\db.json --port 4000".
